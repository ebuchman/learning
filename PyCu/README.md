Running CUDA kernels from python using ctypes.

This is a learning repo.  There are multiple kernels that achieve the same effect, in order to emphasize the differences and gains in efficiency (from using  threads, shared memory, etc.).

Also implements a parallelized KNN using the DTW distance measure for multi-dimensional time series.

Tests are in master.py.
